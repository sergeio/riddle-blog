I recently came across a [riddle]:

    Thereâ€™s a certain country where everybody wants to have a son. Therefore
    each couple keeps having children until they have a boy; then they stop.
    What fraction of the population is female?


Guess and test
--------------

It immediately tickled me.  Just the notion that I apparently have enough
information to answer the question surprises me.

Maybe the wording "everybody wants to have a son" biased me, but I was pretty
sure that such a country would have more sons than daughters.  But I was also
skeptical of my intuition, since Ellenberg's bread and butter is making you
confident you understand something, and then pulling the rug out from under
you.  He's basically a bully, but we all have Stockholm syndrome.

So let's do some mental napkin math: there's 100 families in this country.  50
of them will have a boy and no girls.  Another 25 will have one of each.  And
there we are: 75 boys to 25 girls, and only 25 families left to consider, and
all of them will have boys too.  It seems difficult for the girls to make a
comeback.  That's the feeling.

Next up, I'd approximate the answer with a simulation.  Since all families have
a boy (it seems like people generally ignore the possibility of families that
have daughters, but haven't yet conceived a son), we can say that there is 1
boy per family.  Look at us.  We're doing math.  Girls are a tiny bit more
complicated.  One quarter of families have one girl, an eighth have two girls,
and so on.

Whoa!  They're making a comeback, and we're only 9 terms into this infinite
sum.  I renounce my intuition and would now guess that somehow, the amount of
girls precisely equals the amount of boys in the country.  Well, on average.


But why? How?
-------------

since we're here, this seems like a reasonable time to stop guessing and
approximating, and "do math".

The amount of boys per family is 1 by definition, but since we're doing math,
and we wouldn't want someone to accidentally understand us -- I mean, how then
would we derive our sense of self-worth? -- let us obfuscate:

<p align="center"><img alt="$$ boys/family = S{b}(n) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} = \frac{1},{2} + \frac{1},{4} + \frac{1},{8} + ... $$" src="svgs/5ca9131f80d393946f3009566a5ed655.svg" align="middle" width="382.30995pt" height="44.69883pt"/></p>

And here comes the magic.  We can multiply every term in the sequence by <img alt="$\frac{1},{2}$" src="svgs/516fe87fb4e74d3fe1f7db69ade18f89.svg" align="middle" width="16.744365pt" height="27.77577pt"/>:
<p align="center"><img alt="$$ 2 * S{b}(n) = \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} = 1 + \frac{1},{2} + \frac{1},{4} + \frac{1},{8} + ... $$" src="svgs/5b85abfcb0b03ea96ae65e12545f8074.svg" align="middle" width="320.36895pt" height="44.69883pt"/></p>

We can see that the nth element of Sb(n) equals the (n+1)th element of
<img alt="$2 * S{b}(n)$" src="svgs/33db686c110c8122ded01121f99137de.svg" align="middle" width="64.4787pt" height="24.6576pt"/>.

And being a little clever, we eliminate all those pesky infinite terms:
<p align="center"><img alt="$$ 2 * S{b}(n) - S{b}(n) = 1 + \frac{1}/{2} - \frac{1}/{2} + \frac{1}/{4} - \frac{1}/{4} + \frac{1}/{8} - \frac{1}/{8} + ... = 1 $$" src="svgs/3159c71497894d128ecb50c5c51fb91f.svg" align="middle" width="462.21615pt" height="37.099755pt"/></p>

<p align="center"><img alt="$$S{b}(n) = 1$$" src="svgs/b1a5f33e13f6393bec5d4caffdb036cb.svg" align="middle" width="70.871295pt" height="16.438356pt"/></p>

boys per family = 1

Similarly,

girls per family = sum(n/(2^(n+1))) for n = (1, infinity)
girls per family = 1/2 * sum(n/(2^n)) for n = (1, infinity)
